## Getting started on an embedded systems project

How on earth do you actually get started on your own embedded systems project?

I've been reading datasheet after datasheet trying to understand what components I'll need for my 12 V Lead-acid battery monitoring system and I have made little to no progress.

One of the main components I need is an integrated chip (IC) responsible for monitoring the voltage and State of Charge (SoC) of the 12 V Lead-acid (PbA) battery. I found this:  [BQ34Z100](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq34z100-g1.pdf?HQS=TI-null-null-digikeymode-df-pf-null-wwe&ts=1601794542982), after a multi-hour googling session. 

**Challenges**
- finding the right component
- reading and understanding the datasheet
- wondering how to develop the prototype (how do I obtain hands on an evaluation board or some sort of breakout board to run tests on before final integration into my project?)
- creating the symbols and footprints on your EDA (in my case KiCAD)

The start of my project has indeed been frustrating to say the least, it feels like I'm wading through tar laced with black magic. Alas, that is partly the reason why I decided to get into an electrical engineering PhD program in the first place: because I knew nothing about it and I'm here to struggle and learn.

But damn, it's been roughly 3 years and 6 months and I still can't read an IC datasheet? I need to get better at this whole electrical engineering thing. Ugh.
